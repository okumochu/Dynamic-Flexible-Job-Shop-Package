complexity increase with machine compatibility
- E-data (Easy): one job could process on few machine (average 1-1.15)
- R-data (Random): random 1~2 (average 2)
- V-data (Variable): (average 7.5)


### Format
First line: <number of jobs> <number of machines>
Then one line per job: <number of operations> and then, for each operation, <number of machines for this operation> and for each machine, a pair <machine> <processing time>.
Machine index starts at 0.
